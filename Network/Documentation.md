I worked with Sam Wray and Miles David on THE BANDWIDTH band website.
We started by trying to figure out our band name and bios.
It ended up being called THE BANDWIDTH.
I worked on creating bios with made up characters that are funny and weird.
I tried to make sure it didn't make a lot of sense, that everyone's bio had
a bit of absurdism.
At the same time, we were coming up with a band picture, to add more assets
to the website. We wanted to add an emoji to the page, so Sam tried to carve
out a funny emoji. Unfortunately, after plugging into the code, it did not work.
While writing the bios, Miles was mostly working on the HTML code, which was a
fairly smooth process. We took the code from the website and plugged in our text
from there.
After sending out the bios and plugging everything in, my two partners seemed
to be ahead of the game when it came to coding the site, and after asking them
what else there was for me to do to help, they couldn't think of a particular
task.
So I just watched and supported my team, laughing at their jokes and validating
their coding choices. After the HTML file was done, we worked on adding CSS to
make the font prettier and the vibe more vibey.
Finally, Sam wanted to add an audio file to the website as a cherry on the top.

My shape fits in a 8 x 11 rectangle. So that's the size of my cell.  so is that gonna make it harder since it's a rectangle grid? 
So let my try to have an 8 by 11 grid with an 800 by 1100 canvas.
Okay so this is when I humble myself. 
I asked the emotional support class groupchat because everybody seemed to have square numbers, and they advised that I try to make my shape fit into a square as it would make the process much easier. 
Okay so I'm gonna make it a square, 1000by1000. Which if my logic clicks, means that the grid for each shape is 10by10, and therefore. Wait Let me tone it back I'm getting lost.


So my original canvas is 400by400. 
Which the object redrawn has to be in a 400by400 square. So let me make my canvas for phase 4 1,600 by 1,600 which is just 4x the size, meaning I can make it a 4by4 grid just scaled out, and now I need. OMGOSHH I CAN'T DO THIS :((((

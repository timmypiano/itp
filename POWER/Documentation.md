I feel very confused by this and shall review my basics.

So I pretty much understand how to do it I'm just confused with how to use i for the range, it's like working but I don't know how to get the range right for x and y.

The range is -8 to 9, and everyline is a power of x, so if I put getpower and make it so that x is i, and y has to go up by 2, so (i,2) should work.

It worked. Fire.

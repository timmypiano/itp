 What I did:
    I made an MP3 game where you click on the album and it gets big and starts to play a song from it.
How I did it
    I went on Scratch and made the event that if the sprite was clicked, to stop all sounds and then start a new song, I also created a variable so that we see which vibe the song is setting, vibe 1 or 2.
    I then added a pause button so that the person knew how to stop the music.
Problems I faced
    I had a lot of problems with the logic of everything it wasn't the most intuitive for me.
    I spent some time experimenting with how to move and get around the sprites and after a little bit I got comfortable and it wasn't too hard for me to create an mp3 player.
I didn't use any code from elsewhere for this assignment
